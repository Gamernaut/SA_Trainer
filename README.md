# Situational Awareness Trainer - HSD only version

### TL;DR
Building a mental map of the position of threat aircraft in the 3D space around you is vitally important as a fighter pilot. Learning to do that in a combat scenario is very difficult so I built this training tool to allow virtual pilots to practice interpreting AWACS brevity calls, regarding the position of enemy flights, to build a mental map by simulating the in-cockpit display in a safe environment. This set up allows a realistic training environment without the threats and time pressure of the actual in game environment.
