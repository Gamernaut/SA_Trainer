### TL;DR
A training tool to allow virtual pilots to practice interpreting AWACS brevity calls, regarding the position of enemy flights, to a mental map by simulating the in-cockpit display in a safe environment. This set up allows a realistic training environment without the threats and time pressure of the actual in game environment.
