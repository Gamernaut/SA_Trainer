# Situational Awareness Trainer - HSD only version

### Inspiration:
Building a mental 3D map of the position of threat aircraft in the 3D space around you is vitally important as a fighter pilot. Learning to do that in a combat environment is very difficult so I built this training tool to allow virtual pilots to practice translating AWACS threat calls, in conjunction with the information in the cockpit,  he use of the HSD and bullseye positon , regarding the position of enemy flights, to build a mental map by simulating the in-cockpit display in a safe environment. This set up allows a realistic training environment without the threats and time pressure of the actual in game environment.

### Techniques used:
- Developed trigonometry based functions to determine the relative positions of the various aircraft so they can be plotted on the cockpit display 
- OOP design principles - Inheritance, polymorphism, composition
- Integrating SDL, PLOG and the GoogleTest framework into the codebase

### Languages/Packages:
- Visual Studio 2019
- C++ 11 features (complied against C++20 standard)
- [PLOG](https://github.com/SergiusTheBest/plog)
